/**
 * The leaderboard is derived, never stored.
 *
 * A player's score for a game is their BEST SINGLE RUN, not their latest and
 * not the sum of their runs — so replaying can only ever help. Voided runs
 * (host-granted goodwill re-runs) drop out. The 40-point Fraud Fighter bonus
 * for playing all three games is computed here rather than written to a row,
 * which is why there is no aggregate table anywhere in this schema.
 *
 * Two views, one per scope:
 *  - `leaderboard_today`      — runs from the current Asia/Kolkata calendar day
 *  - `leaderboard_cumulative` — best run per game across the whole event
 *
 * Cumulative is the best run per game over all days rather than the sum of
 * daily bests, which keeps the ceiling at 315 no matter how many days a
 * visitor comes back.
