 * The player session, held in one place.
 *
 * This was per-component `useState` hydrated from localStorage on mount, which
 * meant every component calling the hook kept its own copy of the session:
 * registering updated the form's copy but not the gate rendering it, and
 * ending a session left stale copies mounted elsewhere on the screen. There is
 * only ever one session on a device, so there is only one copy of it here and
 * every subscriber is told when it changes.
 *
 * Reading at module load rather than in an effect also means the very first
 * render already knows whether the player is registered, so guarded routes do
 * not flash through a logged-out state on the way in.
