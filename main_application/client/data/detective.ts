    explanation: "AC-6800 collects ₹36 lakh from eight loan accounts held by borrowers whose declared income cannot support the EMIs — the classic straw-buyer profile. GPS data confirming all eight cars are on the dealer's own lot proves the borrowers never took possession. The uniform disbursement amounts and the fan-in to one account are the graph signals; the income-to-EMI ratio and GPS data are the corroborating evidence.",
